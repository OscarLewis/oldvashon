Hello! Welcome to **_Vanishing Vashon_,** a project I started to make an online geography of Vashon Island's history. The name is a bit of a misnomer, as plenty of the locations detailed in this geography still exist today. The name is heavily inspired by [Vanishing Seattle](https://www.instagram.com/vanishingseattle/?hl=en), plus I liked the alliteration. My goal for the tone of this project is to land somewhere between personal blog/personal experience and academic historical collection. I was inspired to create this when I was talking to my siblings about Movie Magic, where we spent hours of our childhood picking out VHS tapes and later DVDs. This ended up being the first point I added to the map.

I have found some great sources on the Island's history including the fantastic [Vashon Island Blog](https://myvashonislandblog.com/) by Brian Brenno, as well as the [Vashon Heritage Museum](https://vashonheritagemuseum.org/) website which is a trove of well researched articles about all aspects of Island history. [The Beachcomber](https://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/) is always reliable, and I also enjoyed reading [The Vashon Loop](https://vashonloop.com/wordpress/) while growing up.

If you find this and want to contribute, I made a [Google form](https://forms.gle/bbdfr7gksBAyJpUJ8) where suggestions can be made. This project is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/OscarLewis/oldvashon) if you want to make technical contributions.
