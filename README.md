# Vanishing Vashon

A project to preserve old memories of [Vashon Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashon%2C_Washington) online.

It uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), [spl.js](https://github.com/jvail/spl.js), [SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Marked](https://marked.js.org/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Built by [Oscar Lewis](https://oscarlewis.dev/).

## Building

To build this site, you must have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Instructions to do so can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies before running `yarn build` to build the static website in the dist folder.

Running `yarn dev` will start a local development server.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request. I recommend using [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) to edit the files found in the qgis directory, where there is also more information available about the structure of the project.
