# Vanishing Vashon

A project to preserve old memories of [Vashon Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashon%2C_Washington) online.

It uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), [spl.js](https://github.com/jvail/spl.js), [SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Marked](https://marked.js.org/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
