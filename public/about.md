This website is a project to create a digital geography of the history of [Vashon Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashon%2C_Washington). For a place that feels so static in time, the geography of Vashon has undergone significant changes. This project intends to catalouge those changes so future Islanders can learn about it's history. The map contains points representing different memories of Island life. Users can click on different points to view more information.
