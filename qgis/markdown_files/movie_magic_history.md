Movie Magic was the Island's source for home video. It had something for everyone, ranging from a kids room with almost every Scooby Doo vhs tape to excellent employee recomendations along the back wall. The business also sold candy and hosted an espresso stand ran by one of the owners Jackie Merrill. The store successfully transitioned from VHS to DVD rentals in the 2000's but could not compete once the Netflix mail program became popular. The store closed in 2011 after 22 years of serving the Island community.
