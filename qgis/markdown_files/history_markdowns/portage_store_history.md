The original Portage Store was opened in 1903, however it was quickly moved to the north side of the site and replaced by the two story 1906 Portage Store we know today. Islander C.F. Van Olinda built the store, along with
an accompanying Portage Post Office (the first on the island to offer free rural delivery). After Van Olinda sold the store, it was kept open by a series of different owners until 2005. One set of owners, The Smith's, started the tradition of having exercise bikes across the road from the store, so Islanders could get a workout in while looking across the east passage. The store saw the rise and fall of the nearby Portage - Des Moines ferry route (1916 - 1921) which was the primary ferry off vashon before traffic moved to the North End. In 1976, the Canadian rock band Rush stayed in the first Portage Store building while working on their Live album 'All The Worldâ€™s A Stage'.
