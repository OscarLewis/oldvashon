"The Islandâ€™s Only Cinema House", the Vashon Theatre was originally built in 1942 across the street from where it sits now. That first building burned down in 1945 and was rebuilt in 1947 in tit's current home. The Theatre prides itself on it's non-GMO popcorn, which is cooked in a World War 2 era popcorn maker and topped with real butter. In 2012, with the help of funds raised by Islanders, the Theatre installed a new digital projector to ensure the local movie going experience exists for years to come. Even with these improvements, the constant low admission and concession prices allows all Islanders a chance to escape reality. The Theatre is available for private rentals and also puts on events like the ever-popular annual Oscars party.
