"The Islandâ€™s Only Cinema House", the Vashon Theatre was originally built in 1942 across the street from where it sits now. That first building burned down in 1945 and was rebuilt in 1947 in tit's current home. The Theatre prides itself on it's non-GMO popcorn, which is cooked in a World War 2 era popcorn maker and topped with real butter. In 2012, with the help of funds raised by Islanders, the Theatre installed a new digital projector that ensured that the local movie going experience will exist for years to come. Even with the improvements, the Theatre feels stuck in time in the best way. A major reason for this is the Theatre's focus on keeping the price low and the experience accessible to all. Tickets and concessions are very reasonably priced, a large popcorn is only $6. The Theatre is available for private rentals and also puts on events like the ever-popular annual Oscars party. Tickets and more info are available on the [Vashon Theatre](https://vashontheatre.com/) website.
